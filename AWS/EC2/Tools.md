# Available tools for right-sizing

### AWS Compute Optimizer
AWS Compute Optimizer is a right-sizing recommendation tool that you can use to improve your AWS infrastructure efficiency. Compute Optimizer analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your current resources and then generates recommendations for more optimal configurations by considering both cost and performance. It evaluates your resources using your default Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze usage patterns from data acquired over the previous 14 days. The service has no additional charge by default.

### Pricing Calculator
AWS Pricing Calculator is a web-based planning tool that you can use to create estimates for your AWS use cases. You can use it to model your solutions before building them, explore the AWS service price points, and review the calculations behind your estimates. You can use it to help you plan how you spend, find cost saving opportunities, and make informed decisions when using AWS.

With AWS Pricing Calculator, you can do the following tasks:

* **View transparent prices** – View the calculations behind the estimated prices for your service configurations. You can view price estimates by service or by groups of services to analyze your architecture costs.

* **Use groups for hierarchical estimates** – Sort your estimates into groups to align with your architecture for clear service cost analysis.
Share your estimates – Save the link to each estimate to share or revisit at a later time. Estimates are saved to the AWS public servers.

* **Export your estimates** – Export your estimates in comma-separated values (CSV) or portable document format (PDF) files to share locally with your stakeholders.

### Cost Explorer

You can use AWS Cost Explorer to view and analyze your costs and usage. You can view data for up to the last 12 months, forecast how much you're likely to spend for the next 12 months, and get recommendations for what Reserved Instances to purchase. You can use Cost Explorer to identify areas that need further investigation and view trends that you can use to understand your costs.

You can view your costs and usage using the Cost Explorer user interface (UI) at no additional cost. Cost Explorer provides preconfigured views that display at-a-glance information about your cost trends and gives you a head start on customizing views that suit your needs.

The right-sizing recommendations feature in Cost Explorer helps you identify cost-saving opportunities by downsizing or terminating instances in Amazon EC2. Right-sizing recommendations analyze your Amazon EC2 resources and usage to show opportunities for how you can lower your spending. You can see all of your underused EC2 instances across member accounts in a single view to immediately identify how much you can save. After you identify your recommendations, you can take action on the Amazon EC2 console.
