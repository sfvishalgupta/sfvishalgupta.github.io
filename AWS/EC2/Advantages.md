# Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Benefit from massive economic scale**
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices. 

2. **Stop guessing capacity**
Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing resources, such as Amazon EC2, these problems can go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and you can configure your environment to automatically scale up and down as needed.

3. **Increase Speed and Agility**
In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you can reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

4. **Stop spending money running & maintaining data centers**
Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. With cloud computing, you can focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

5. **Trade fixed expense for variable expense**
Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources and pay only for how much you consume.

6. **Go global in minutes**
Deploy your application in multiple ÀWS Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means that you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
