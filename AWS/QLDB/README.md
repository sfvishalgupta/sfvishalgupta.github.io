# Amazon Quantum Ledger Database

* AWS QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log owned by a central trusted authority. You can use Amazon QLDB to track all application data changes, and maintain a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. 

* The main goal of QLDB is to track the history of changes happened on the data while maintaining the integrity of data. The history of changes is immutable and verifiable.

* **QLDB is serverless** so it is scalable by design and suitable for applications of all types of traffic.

* Amazon QLDB is a new class of database that helps eliminate the need to engage in the complex development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, the history of changes to your data is immutableâ€”it can't be overwritten or altered in place. And using cryptography, you can verify that there have been no unintended changes to your application's data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known as a journal.
