# Filter Pattern Cheat Sheet

You can use special characters in path, branch, and tag filters.

* *: Matches zero or more characters, but does not match the / character. For example, Octo* matches Octocat.

* **: Matches zero or more of any character.

* ?: Matches zero or one of the preceding character.

* +: Matches one or more of the preceding character.

* [] Matches one alphanumeric character listed in the brackets or included in ranges. Ranges can only include a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. For example, the range[0-9a-z] matches any digit or lowercase letter. For example, [CB]at matches Cat or Bat and [1-2]00 matches 100 and 200.

* !: At the start of a pattern makes it negate previous positive patterns. It has no special meaning if not the first character.

* The characters *, [, and ! are special characters in YAML. If you start a pattern with *, [, or !, you must enclose the pattern in quotes. Also, if you use a flow sequence with a pattern containing [ and/or ], the pattern must be enclosed in quotes.

```yaml
# Valid
paths:
  - '**/README.md'

# Invalid - creates a parse error that
# prevents your workflow from running.
paths:
  - **/README.md

# Valid
branches: [ main, 'release/v[0-9].[0-9]' ]

# Invalid - creates a parse error
branches: [ main, release/v[0-9].[0-9] ]
```

## Pattern to match branch and tags

| Pattern   | Description       | Example matches       |
| :---      | :---              | :---                  |
| 
| feature/* | The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/). | feature/my-branch <br><br> feature/your-branch |
| feature/** | The ** wildcard matches any character including slash (/) in branch and tag names. | feature/beta-a/my-branch <br><br> feature/your-branch <br><br> feature/mona/the/octocat |
| main <br ><br >releases/mona-the-octocat | Matches the exact name of a branch or tag name. | main <br> <br> releases/mona-the-octocat
| '*'  | Matches all branch and tag names that don't contain a slash (/). The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes. | main <br> <br> releases | 
| '**' | Matches all branch and tag names. This is the default behavior when you don't use a branches or tags filter. | all/the/branches<br> <br> every/tag |
| '*feature' | The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes. | mona-feature <br><br> feature <br><br> ver-10-feature
| v2* | Matches branch and tag names that start with v2. | v2 <br><br> v2.0 <br><br> v2.9 |
| v[12].[0-9]+.[0-9]+ | Matches all semantic versioning branches and tags with major version 1 or 2. | v1.10.1 <br><br> v2.0.0


## Pattern to match file path
| Pattern                                       | Description of matches    | Example matches       |
| ---                                           | ---   | ---     |
| '*'                                           | The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/). The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes. | README.md <br><br>server.rb |
| '*.jsx?'                                      | The ? character matches zero or one of the preceding character. | page.js <br><br> page.jsx |
| '**'                                          | The ** wildcard matches any character including slash (/). This is the default behavior when you don't use a path filter. | all/the/files.md |
| '*.js'                                        | The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/). Matches all .js files at the root of the repository. | app.js <br><br> index.js |
| '**.js'                                       | Matches all .js files in the repository. | index.js <br><br> js/index.js <br><br> src/js/app.js |
| docs/*                                        | All files within the root of the docs directory, at the root of the repository. | docs/README.md <br><br> docs/file.txt |
| docs/**                                       | Any files in the /docs directory at the root of the repository. | docs/README.md <br><br> docs/mona/octocat.txt |
| docs/**/*.md                                  | A file with a .md suffix anywhere in the docs directory. | docs/README.md <br><br> docs/mona/hello-world.md <br><br> docs/a/markdown/file.md | 
| '**/docs/**'                                  | Any files in a docs directory anywhere in the repository. | docs/hello.md <br><br> dir/docs/my-file.txt <br><br> space/docs/plan/space.doc |
| '**/README.md'                                | A README.md file anywhere in the repository. | README.md <br><br> js/README.md |
| '**/*src/**'                                  | Any file in a folder with a src suffix anywhere in the repository. | a/src/app.js <br><br> my-src/code/js/app.js |
| '**/*-post.md'                                | A file with the suffix -post.md anywhere in the repository. | my-post.md <br><br> path/their-post.md | 
| '**/migrate-*.sql'                            | A file with the prefix migrate- and suffix .sql anywhere in the repository. | migrate-10909.sql <br><br> db/migrate-v1.0.sql <br><br> db/sept/migrate-v1.sql |
| '*.md' <br><br>'!README.md'                   | Using an exclamation mark (!) in front of a pattern negates it. When a file matches a pattern and also matches a negative pattern defined later in the file, the file will not be included. | hello.md <br><br> Does not match <br><br> README.md <br><br> docs/hello.md |
| '*.md' <br><br> '!README.md' <br><br> README* | Patterns are checked sequentially. A pattern that negates a previous pattern will re-include file paths. | hello.md <br><br> README.md <br><br> README.doc |
