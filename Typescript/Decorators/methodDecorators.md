# Method Decorators

A Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration. The decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition. A method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class). We have already seen the example of method decorators so wonâ€™t be going into any further details:

```typescript
class User {
  constructor(private name: string, private age: number) {}

  @logger
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }

  @logger
  printAge() {
    console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old`);
  }
}

const user = new User("Ron", 25);
user.greet();
user.printAge();

Output: 
start: greet
Hello, my name is Ron.
end: greet
start: printAge
I am 25 years old
end: printAge
```
