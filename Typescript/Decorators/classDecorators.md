# Class Decorators

A Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration. The class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition. A class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a declare class).

The expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.

If the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function. â€œShould you choose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype. The logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.

```typescript
@BaseEntity
class User {
  [x: string]: any;
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}

function BaseEntity(ctr: Function) {
  ctr.prototype.created = new Date().toISOString();
}

const user = new User('John')
console.log(user.name, user.created)
```
